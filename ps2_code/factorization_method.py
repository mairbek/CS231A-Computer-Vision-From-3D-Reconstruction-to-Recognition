'''
FACTORIZATION_METHOD The Tomasi and Kanade Factorization Method to determine
the 3D structure of the scene and the motion of the cameras.
Arguments:
    points_im1 - N points in the first image that match with points_im2
    points_im2 - N points in the second image that match with points_im1

    Both points_im1 and points_im2 are from the get_data_from_txt_file() method
Returns:
    structure - the structure matrix
    motion - the motion matrix
